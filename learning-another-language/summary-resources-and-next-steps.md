# Summary, Resources, and Next Steps

## What We've Discovered So Far

For now, we can run JavaScript programs using a REPL. Eventually, we will have more context about the JavaScript we're writing, and we'll run JavaScript programs based on that.

### Hello, World!

- We print values to the console using `console.log(<value to print>)`, where `<value to print>` is a literal or other expression
- We invoke functions with parentheses `()`
- The dot operator allows us to access the `log` function from the `console` object
- Statements end in a semicolon `;`

### FizzBuzz

- We declare a variable using `const <nameOfVariable>`, where `<nameOfVariable>` is the name of a variable, usually in camelCase
- We can use the assignment operator, the equal sign `=`, to assign a variable a value on the right side
- We define a function starting with the `function` keyword, followed by a list of parameters in parentheses `()`, followed by the function body in curly braces `{}`
- If-statements are made with `if`, followed by a conditional expression in `()`, followed by a block of code in curly braces `{}`
- We indent inner blocks of code
- JavaScript shares the use of the mod operator `%` and `return` statements with a number of other languages
- The preferred comparison operator `===` still strongly resembles the `==` we are used to

## Resources

Finding the right resources comes with practice and time.

When we need to research something, it might be to answer one of these questions:

1. How do we _do_ something?
1. What _is_ the definition of something? How does something work? What do I need to know?

### Suggested Starting Places

When we need to learn how to _do_ something, as a suggestion, we can focus on:

- The syntax to accomplish it
- The expected result
- Finding variations of different syntaxes for different situations
- Tutorials to achieve what we need
- StackOverflow answers
- Documentation and reference material about the syntax

When learning what _is_ something and how something works, we can focus on:

- Learning how something fits in with JavaScript
- Videos or diagrams explaining the process
- Blogs
- Documentation and reference material about the concepts

### Suggested Ways to Evaluate

For any given resource, we can evaluate based on:

| Criteria                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date written/published      | The older that a resource is, the more outdated it is with JavaScript _syntax_. Concepts and patterns change every few years, too.                                         |
| Context                     | Who wrote this? Why did they write it? What biases do they carry? What is the intended purpose of this material?                                                           |
| Source                      | It's helpful to distinguish between an independent developer or a product who authored a resource. Both kinds of authors genuinely want to better the developer community. |
| Depth                       | Sometimes we don't need very deep explanations for some syntax. Sometimes we need deep explanations to understand a fundamental concept.                                   |
| Number and Kind of Examples | Depends on what we're looking for!                                                                                                                                         |

### !callout-info

## ECMAScript 2015, aka ES6

The JavaScript language went through a major revision in 2015. It introduced _dozens_ of new syntax elements, features, and patterns. There is usually a large difference in code style patterns between JavaScript before 2015 and after 2015.

<br/>

To acknowledge this shift, many developers explicitly call out using "ES6" JavaScript.

### !end-callout

## Next Steps

When learning another language, after taking these notes, it might be wise to pause and consider what subjects of JavaScript are worth diving into.

We've compiled a list of those topics for us:

- Semicolons
- Variables
- Objects
- Functions

Now we have some direction about what to research!
