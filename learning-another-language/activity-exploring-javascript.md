# Activity: Exploring JavaScript Features

## Goal

Our goal is to practice looking up JavaScript features and boiling them down into essential concepts and explaining those concepts to our fellow students.


## Activity Instructions

Each group of 3-4 students will investigate **one** of the following features of JavaScript or coding concepts:

1. [Default parameters](https://wesbos.com/javascript/02-functions/functions-parameters-and-arguments) and the [forEach loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)
1. [Hoisting](https://wesbos.com/javascript/02-functions/different-ways-to-declare-functions/#hoisting)
1. [Switch Statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)
1. [null & undefined](https://wesbos.com/javascript/01-the-basics/types-null-and-undefined) and [Truthyness in JavaScript](https://wesbos.com/javascript/07-logic-and-flow-control/if-statements-function-returns-truthy-falsy)
1. [JavaScript & The DOM](https://wesbos.com/javascript/04-the-dom/introduction-to-the-dom)
1. [The Ternary Operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator)
1. [The Array Map Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)


Each team will create a lesson for the larger class on their topics and present the concept in 5-7 minutes. You are encouraged to create Google Slides, and example code in replit.com illustrating the concepts.

You may use the linked resource as well as any other documentation you can find. The following sites can be very helpful:

- [MDN on JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Wes Bos on JavaScript](https://wesbos.com/javascript)
- [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

## Timeline

You will have:

- 30 minutes of research time to explore the topic.
- 5-7 minutes to present the topic to the larger class

You are not expected to teach every subtle feature, but rather to give your classmates an overview of the topic. This can prime them to learn more of the topic as needed.
