# Welcome!

In the transition between Ada Developer Academy's textbook curriculum to core curriculum, we lost a lot, and we preserved a lot.

The HTML and CSS curriculum has not changed significantly.

The order of the material and lessons has changed a lot. The old material has been broken into a different flow.

However, no new content has changed, except for the addition of the Problem Set in "Structuring Content."

If you're looking for another way to view our HTML/CSS material, consider [this record of Ada videos from C14 (Fall 2020)](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%2214581e7b-e913-4a4d-b1d7-ac4b01449065%22).
