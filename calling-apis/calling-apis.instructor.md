# Instructor: Calling APIs

## POST Requests With axios

This lesson will make use of the [Ada Trip Reserving Service™ Trip API™™™](https://github.com/AdaGold/trip-api), so make sure it's running.

## Managing Asynchronous Calls

I chose the ridiculous variables `seattleCoordinates.seattleLat` and `seattleCoordinates.seattleLon` because it's easier to debug... the API requires plenty of `lat` and `lon` and `latitude` and `longitude`.

I thought that since the lesson is about tracing code, that having distinct variable names would help with teaching/demonstrating more. I wouldn't expect anyone to write code with these var names lol
