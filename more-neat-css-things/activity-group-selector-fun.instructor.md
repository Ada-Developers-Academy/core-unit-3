# Instructor: Activity: Group Selector Fun

The point of this one is to live-code CSS and show the wildness of it.

Whenever I've done live-coding of CSS, there was a lot of relief from students to go "Oooooh. You yell at your CSS and you refresh a bunch and you tweak stuff and you use dev tools."

Give them that relief! Model for them that it's challenging to get that text _just the right_ size. Fiddle with stuff!

Refresh the page a bunch! Look up every style on Google. It's CSS, baby!
