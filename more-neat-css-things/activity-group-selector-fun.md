## Goal

Our goal is to ask and answer questions during CSS development! Learning about CSS is often most useful when there is HTML in front of you.

## Activity Instructions

The goal of this activity is to _leave the given HTML as-is_ and apply our selector knowledge to style the elements appropriately.

1. Clone the [selector-fun repo](https://github.com/AdaGold/selector-fun)
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
1. Spend five minutes reading through the HTML and CSS files. We'll be writing CSS for `index.html`, so it will be to our advantage to notice the HTML structure, IDs, and classes.

### Group Live-coding!

Let's do group live-coding while asking and answering our CSS questions!

The facilitator will start as the leader, who will begin to live-code the CSS solutions.

During this time, they will practice talking about selectors, and the thought process and dev process working on it.

- Ask questions!
- Offer answers!
- Practice vocabulary!
- Take notes!

When the facilitator is ready, they will pass on the leader role to another person. Every leader will present their screen and collaboratively code the CSS solutions.

## How to Review

- What did you observe was the leader's workflow? How often did they check the browser? What conclusions can you make from that?
- How often did the leader look up something online, and for what properties and values?
