# Instructor: Problem Set: Functions

- The `isOdd` questions are there and repetitive to get students to practice syntax
- The `isOddNumber` question is there to reinforce working with `NaN`, conditionals, etc.
- The `giveGreeting` question is there to reinforce callbacks

Question #3's sample answer uses the fact that `[] % 2` is `0`. TBH I don't know the reason why for this, or a good explanation. If I were asked this question, I'd make a hypothesis and then encourage their curiosity, "I have no idea why a language would decide to do this. I personally would research 'javascript modulo objects'."

Other fun things to bring up are:

- `[] + []` is `""`
- `[] * []` is `0`
- `[] - []` is `0`
- `[] / []` is `NaN`
