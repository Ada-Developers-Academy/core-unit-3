# Activity: Structuring Personal Portfolio

## Goals

Our coding skills improve with repetition.

In this first activity, we will build the HTML structure of our personal portfolio website using semantic HTML tags, as well as proper indentation to show the relationship between parent and child elements.

## Activity Instructions

### Setup

Fork the following repo: [personal portfolio website](), then clone it to your local machine. From here you can begin creating the following pages based on the requirements below.

### Requirements

This portfolio should have the following pages:
├── `index.html`
├── `about.html`
└── `portfolio.html`

### Page Details
- `index.html` must include your name somewhere.

- `about.html` should include some information about you, your interests, background or similar. Only post what you're comfortable sharing.

- `portfolio.html` must include information about several projects you've completed at Ada (or elsewhere) with links to the GitHub repo if available, descriptions, images, etc.

### Required Page Structure
Each page in this project must comply with the following layout requirements:
- Has the following tags: `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<nav>`
- Inside of the `<nav>`, there are links to all of the other pages
