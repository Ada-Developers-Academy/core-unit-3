# Hello, World!

## Goals

Our goal is to practice diving into a new library. By creating a Hello, World! project, we'll gain knowledge about how to start and run a React webapp.

## Format

To jump into front-end development with React, we will create a Hello, World! app.

We'll take the following steps:

1. Introduce the tool that will create an initial React app on our machine
1. Run a local server to look at our React app
1. Read through React code, namely the `App` component

## Using a Toolchain

We will use a specific tool to help us begin a minimal React app: the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) tool.

Create React App creates a new project, which includes starter HTML, CSS, and JS files, the React library, a recommended folder structure, and useful packages.

To use Create React App, we use this command:

```bash
$ npx create-react-app hello-world
```

| `npx`                                               | A CLI tool that runs packages. In this curriculum, we will use this infrequently, mostly only in this scenario when we are creating a new React project.                                                |
| `create-react-app`                                  | A package that includes the command for Create React App, which creates a minimal React app.                                     |
| `hello-world`                                       | **Replace this** with the name of your new React project. This will be the name of the project and the generated project folder. |

If `npx` isn't available, we should follow directions to install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js includes `npm`. `npm` 5.2+ includes `npx`.

### !callout-info

## Node.js Is JavaScript

We have seen JavaScript running in the browser, and in editing environments such as Replit.com. Now we are going to start working with JavaScript on our own machines. The runtime environment we use for this is called Node.js.

<br />

To start our project we use `npx`, which eXecutes Node Packages. Node packages are the primary way that JavaScript libraries are shared, and we will learn more about installing and using them ourselves in later lessons!

### !end-callout

After running `create-react-app`, we'll have a new project folder. We should `cd` into our project folder before we do anything else!

```bash
$ cd hello-world
```

## Running A Server

Let's look at what the `create-react-app` tool has given us!

As part of using Create React App, we'll begin to use the `yarn` CLI tool. With `yarn` CLI, we'll be able to run scripts that are defined in `package.json`, a file also generated by Create React App. These scripts can run servers that load and reload our React app, which simplifies our development workflow.

In our project root, we start a server with this command in the terminal:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

By default, our front-end is viewable at `localhost:3000`.

Every time we make a change in a file and save it, our server will detect the changes and then reload the app immediately.

## VSCode Autosave, Meet React Autoload

It's often convenient to have our editor automatically save our files as we're working to help us avoid needless hours spent debugging an issue that was ultimately caused by forgetting to save a file. However, this help can become a hindrance when we are working with a program like React that watches for changes and then reloads. Since VSCode saves constantly, even while in the middle of typing a line of code, it's possible (actually common!) for React to try reloading our code when it's not syntactically correct, causing errors in our project.

<br />

When working with React, or other autoloading programs, it's a good idea to disable the VSCode autosave feature. Under the File menu, simply uncheck Auto Save!

## Inspecting the Code

Our project should have the following structure:

```
├── public
│   └── index.html
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── reportWebVitals.js
│   └── setupTests.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

In this curriculum, we will intentionally not cover the following files:

- The contents of `public` besides `index.html`
- `logo.svg`
- `reportWebVitals.js`
- `setupTests.js`

There are two files that are the most important to understand when developing with React for the first time:

1. `src/index.js`
1. `src/App.js`

### Exploring `index.js`

Let's go ahead and open this project up in our text editor to examine the files that have been created for us. We'll begin with `src/index.js` and practice our reading skills.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

### `index.js` Is the Starting Point

`index.js` is responsible for being the starting point of our webapp.

It is the entry point of our project; our app is configured to look for this file first when we run the app.

This file renders our first _JSX_ (described in another lesson).

```js
<React.StrictMode>
  <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

This code indicates that when we start our React webapp, it will _render_ an `App` component using `<App />`.

Aside from seeing that this is how the `App` component gets loaded, we will rarely visit `src/index.js` in this curriculum, even though there are lines of code in this file that are worth exploring with bigger projects.

Instead, we'll focus on working with the `App` component.

### Exploring `App.js`

Consider the contents of `src/App.js`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

From reading `src/App.js`, answer the questions below. If a question involves an expression that hasn't been discussed yet, we can hypothesize what it might do based on what we know about other languages, or from what a natural language reading might imply.

### `App.js` Defines Our `App` Component

The `App` function defines a component named `App`.

The responsibility of the `App` function is to return _how_ to render the `App` component whenever the `App` component is declared and used.

### !callout-info

## Explore!

Now is a great time to explore our webapp. We can change the headers and text, and observe how any changes get reflected in our browser.

<br />

Notice that `create-react-app` automatically initialized a Git repository in our directory. So if something breaks during our exploration we can always get back to the initial version of the files using our Git skills!
