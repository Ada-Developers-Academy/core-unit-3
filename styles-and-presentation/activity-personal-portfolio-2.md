# Activity: Structuring Personal Portfolio

## Goals

Our coding skills improve with repetition.

In this second activity, we will style our personal portfolio pages with CSS, keeping in mind the power of classes and ids.

## Activity Instructions

### Requirements

This portfolio should have at least one CSS stylesheet (likely named  `styles.css`). Each page may use the same stylesheet, or you can create distinct stylesheets for each page.

There are no restrictions or requirements for what CSS properties you use. Follow your curiosity and style your personal portfolio any way you wish!

## A Word of Caution
A lot of developers find their initial foray into CSS frustrating. Every browser implements the CSS standard a little (or a lot) differently. Learning to manipulate elements and understand the box model takes time. Layout can be especially challenging to developers new to CSS. 

For this project, focus on understanding the mechanics and semantics of HTML and CSS, and how the two work together.
